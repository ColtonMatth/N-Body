The N-Body Project was an assignment given by our professor for the Introduction of Computer Science II course. The task involved completing a java file template provided by the professor in order to run a simulation. The simulation showed how more than two objects interacted with each other based on their varying masses and velocities. It was an interesting project that allowed students to gain a deeper understanding of how objects behave in space.
